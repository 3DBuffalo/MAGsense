# MAGsense: Magnetic Sensor

## Description
The 3DBU MAGsense is a compact, low-power magnetic sensor that outputs a digital signal to indicate magnetic field presence: high for detection and low for no field. Its intuitive design makes it ideal for robotics applications like FRC, FTC, and DIY projects. Featuring four Texas Instruments DRV5032 omnipolar Hall-effect sensors, it delivers reliable and accurate performance in a space-efficient form factor.

## Getting Started
The MAGsense magnetic limit switch uses a digital output signal, making it very simple to use and verstile and supported among various devices such as the 3DBU Echo MK1, REV control hub, RoboRIO, arduino, Raspberry PI, ETC. In this repo, there are examples for:
* [FRC Java](https://github.com/3DBuffalo/MAGsense/blob/main/examples/FRC.java)
* [FRC C++](https://github.com/3DBuffalo/MAGsense/blob/main/examples/FRC.cpp)
* [FRC Python](https://github.com/3DBuffalo/MAGsense/blob/main/examples/FRC.py)
* [FTC Java](https://github.com/3DBuffalo/MAGsense/blob/main/examples/FTC.java)
* [Arduino/ESP32/ETC](https://github.com/3DBuffalo/MAGsense/blob/main/examples/Arduino.ino)

## Data Sheet
The MAGsense datasheet only includes information about the sensor itself, not the case.
